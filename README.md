# Business Card

Business Card is an introductory UI App that contains some informations including:
- A picture followed by my full name.
- Some animated titulars acquired during my professional and academic career. (To achieve this feature, I used the (animated_text_kit)[https://pub.dev/packages/animated_text_kit] package)
- Three clickable tiles combined with the card widget that represent some of my personal infos including my phone number, my email and my location;
  - When the user tapes on one of the tile, the system will redirect him to the concerned screen (an app, so to speak). For example, if the user clicks on the phone number, the email or the location component, he will be redirected to the phone app, the gmail app or the Google maps app respectively. (The feature supports android and IOS platforms)
- A speed dial floating button that displays some of my social media profiles
- To reach out the 2 features above, I used the (url_launcher)[https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher] package
